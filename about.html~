      <p>“I am truthing.” or “I truth.” is the literal meaning of the word <i><b><a href="index.html" class="link" color="black">ἀληθεύω</a></b></i>.</p>
      <p>I am convinced that <i>truth</i> is not only something to be searchced, found, learned, grasped, appreciated, spoken, shared, or treasured. In fact, the ultimate truth, or <i>Truth</i>, is not some<i>thing</i> but some<i>one</i>. It is someone for us to <i>become</i> and <i>embody</i>.</p>
      <p>Truth is a <b>person</b>. His name is Jesus. He walked on the earth 2000 years ago. He died for the sin of all mankind and resurrected on the third day. Whoever believes into His name, that is, into His very <i>person</i>, receives the indestructible, eternal life of the true God and is given the capacity to know the truth, walk in truth, and even become truth—to truth.</p>
      <p> A life of truthing is the most freeing, fulfilling, and fantastic life anyone can possibly live.</p>
